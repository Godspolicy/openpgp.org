title: "The 6th OpenPGP Email Summit, May 2022"
permalink: /community/email-summit/2022/
---

**Purpose:** Meeting of experts to discuss technical details around
encrypted emails using OpenPGP.

This is an event open for anybody involved in the development of email
clients using OpenPGP for encryption.

The meeting will take place on **May 27/28, 2022** in Geneva
(Switzerland), with the option to already meet informally on May 26.

**NOTE:** This is a meeting of those who develop
software related to OpenPGP email. Thus, we
will have a lot of tech talk about key servers, key discovery, subject
encryption, password recovery, security/policies, etc. If you just are
interested in these topics as a user, you probably will be bored to
death ;-) .

Thus, you\'re very welcome to join us if you are working in the area of

-   **technical details**
-   for **sending encrypted emails**
-   with **OpenPGP**
-   in a project or product

**Rules:** This is a public meeting. As we want to be fully transparent,
anything discussed during the meeting is considered public.

If you want to attend, please add your name to the [List of
Attendees](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/EtMIfWF2q6qP+c3iv8qNH+x0/)
