title: "The 3rd OpenPGP Email Summit, July 2016"
permalink: /community/email-summit/2016/
---

**Purpose:** Meeting of experts to discuss technical details of sending
encrypted emails using OpenPGP.

This is an event open for anybody involved in the development of email
clients using OpenPGP for encryption.

**NOTE:** This is a meeting of those who program
and develop the corresponding software. Thus, we will have a lot of tech
talk about key servers, key exchange, subject encryption, password
recovery, etc. If you just are interested in these email program as a
user, you probably will be bored to death ;-) .

Thus, if you are working in the area of

-   **technical details**
-   for **sending encrypted emails**
-   with **OpenPGP**
-   in a project or product feel free to join us.

Note however, that due to capacity reasons we don't want to have more
than 2 guys from each project and we can accept requests only until we
have reached the limit of 30 attendees at our host Giegerich & Partner
in Dreieich (near Frankfurt).

**Rules:** By Default, we follow [Chatham House
Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): It is
fine to tell/write about what happened there, but we **need explicit
permission to quote statements by individual persons or to attach them
to organizations**.

If you want to attend, please **send an informal email** to:
[mailto:nico@enigmail.net](mailto:nico@enigmail.net) (ideally
with some description of your role in this area). That way you will get
further details such as the location and hotel informations.
