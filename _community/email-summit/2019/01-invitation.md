title: "5th OpenPGP Email Summit, October 2019"
permalink: /community/email-summit/2019/
---

**Purpose:** Meeting of experts to discuss technical details of sending
encrypted emails using OpenPGP.

This is an event open for anybody involved in the development of email
clients using OpenPGP for encryption.

The meeting will take place on **October 12/13, 2019** in Berlin
(Germany).

**NOTE:** This is a meeting of those who develop
software related to OpenPGP email. Thus, we
will have a lot of tech talk about key servers, key discovery, subject
encryption, password recovery, security/policies, etc. If you just are
interested in these topics as a user, you probably will be bored to
death ;-) .

Thus, you're very welcome to join us if you are working in the area of

-   **technical details**
-   for **sending encrypted emails**
-   with **OpenPGP**
-   in a project or product

Note however, that due to capacity reasons we don't want to have more
than 2 people from each project/product. As space is limited, we can
accept only around 40 attendees at the Onion Space in Berlin.

**Rules:** This is a public meeting. As we want to be fully transparent,
anything discussed during the meeting is considered public.

If you want to attend, please **send an informal email** to Patrick
Brunschwig:
[mailto:patrick@enigmail.net](mailto:patrick@enigmail.net)
(ideally with some description of your role in this area).

If you need funding for your travel/hotel expenses please also get in
contact with Patrick.
