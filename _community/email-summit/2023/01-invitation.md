## Location {#Location}

### Reaching the office {#Reaching_the_office}

In Geneva, when staying in a hotel, you are provided with a
complimentary public transport pass. This pass will allow you to use all
public transports (train, tram, bus, even the yellow boats on the lake)
within the extensive Geneva area (zone 10) for the entire duration of
your stay, including your departure day.

You should receive the pass by email 3 days in advance, so that you can
even use it when travelling from the airport or train station to the
hotel. There\'s no need to print it, if you can show it on a smartphone,
that should be sufficient.

Even AirBnBs are required to offer this pass, as it\'s covered by the
city tax. If you\'re staying at an AirBnB you might want to ask the host
to confirm that you\'ll get one (it\'s free for the host but they need
to register for it).

If you don\'t receive a pass, or need an additional public transport
ticket, you can purchase it from the machines or using the TPG app.
