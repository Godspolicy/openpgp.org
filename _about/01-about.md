OpenPGP is a non-proprietary format for authenticating or encrypting data, using public key cryptography.

It is based on the original PGP ([Pretty Good Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP)) software, created by [Phil Zimmermann](https://philzimmermann.com/).

Beginning in 1997, the OpenPGP Working Group was formed in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to define this standard that had formerly been a proprietary product since 1991.

Over the past decade, PGP, and later OpenPGP, has become the standard for nearly all of the world's signed or encrypted email.

OpenPGP also defines a standard format for certificates which, unlike most other certificate formats, enables [webs of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

OpenPGP formats and uses are specified in many [IETF RFCs and drafts](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/)[^rfcs], so these standards can be implemented by any company without paying any licensing fees to anyone.

[^rfcs]: [RFC 3156](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3156) MIME Security with OpenPGP, [RFC 9580](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9580.html) OpenPGP (the main one), [RFC 6091](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6091) Using OpenPGP Keys for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authentication, and [more](/about/standard/).
